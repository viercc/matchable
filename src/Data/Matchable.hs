  Decides if two structures match exactly. If they match, return zipped version of them.

  > zipMatch ta tb = Just tab

  holds if and only if both of

  > ta = fmap fst tab
  > tb = fmap snd tab

  holds. Otherwise, @zipMatch ta tb = Nothing@.

  For example, the type signature of @zipMatch@ on the list Functor @[]@ reads as follows:

  > zipMatch :: [a] -> [b] -> Maybe [(a,b)]

  @zipMatch as bs@ returns @Just (zip as bs)@ if the lengths of two given lists are
  same, and returns @Nothing@ otherwise.

  ==== Example
  >>> zipMatch [1, 2, 3] ['a', 'b', 'c']
  Just [(1,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'c')]
  >>> zipMatch [1, 2, 3] ['a', 'b']
  Nothing

  Match two structures. If they match, zip them with given function
  @(a -> b -> Maybe c)@. Passed function can make whole match fail
  by returning @Nothing@.

  A definition of 'zipMatchWith' must satisfy:

      * If there is a pair @(tab, tc)@ such that fulfills all following three conditions,
        then @zipMatchWith f ta tb = Just tc@.

            1. @ta = fmap fst tab@
            2. @tb = fmap snd tab@
            3. @fmap (uncurry f) tab = fmap Just tc@

      * If there are no such pair, @zipMatchWith f ta tb = Nothing@.

  If @t@ is also 'Traversable', the last condition can be dropped and
  the equation can be stated without using @tc@.

  > zipMatchWith f ta tb = traverse (uncurry f) tab
  
  @zipMatch@ can be defined in terms of @zipMatchWith@.
  And if @t@ is also @Traversable@, @zipMatchWith@ can be defined in terms of @zipMatch@.
  When you implement both of them by hand, keep their relation in the way
  the default implementation is.

  > zipMatch             = zipMatchWith (curry pure)
  > zipMatchWith f ta tb = zipMatch ta tb >>= traverse (uncurry f)

-- * Generic definition

{-|

An instance of Matchable can be implemened through GHC Generics.
You only need to do two things: Make your type @Functor@ and @Generic1@.

==== Example
>>> :set -XDeriveFunctor
>>> :set -XDeriveGeneric
>>> :{
  data MyTree label a = Leaf a | Node label [MyTree label a]
    deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord, Functor, Generic1)
:}

Then you can use @genericZipMatchWith@ to implement @zipMatchWith@ method.
You also need @Eq1@ instance, but 'liftEqDefault' is provided.

>>> :{
  instance (Eq label) => Matchable (MyTree label) where
    zipMatchWith = genericZipMatchWith
  instance (Eq label) => Eq1 (MyTree label) where
    liftEq = liftEqDefault
  :}

>>> zipMatch (Node "foo" [Leaf 1, Leaf 2]) (Node "foo" [Leaf 'a', Leaf 'b'])
Just (Node "foo" [Leaf (1,'a'),Leaf (2,'b')])
>>> zipMatch (Node "foo" [Leaf 1, Leaf 2]) (Node "bar" [Leaf 'a', Leaf 'b'])
Nothing
>>> zipMatch (Node "foo" [Leaf 1]) (Node "foo" [])
Nothing
